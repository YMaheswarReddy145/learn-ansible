To store the password parameters in a centralized place we use the Parameter store.
In AWS if we search for a parameter store we get a service from system manager as a feature.
Now create a parameter by selecting the create parameter option.
while creating the parameter we need to provide bellow things
    1. parameter name
    2. If we want to provide any string value then we select STRING (or) if you  want to give a password then we select
       SECURE STRING option.

This is the way to crete the parameter in parameter store and read it form the ansible.


If i  want to store some parameters i can also go with ansible variables, but however we are trying to store it in a
  centralized place, because the data whatever we are going to use on the projects may not be necessarily needed only
  for ansible but lso needed for other systems.

To create a parameter we follow some patterns as below:
   1. <MICROSERVICENAME>.<ENV>.<KEY> or <MICROSERVICENAME>/<ENV>/<KEY>
   2. <ENV>.<MICROSEVICENAME>.<KEY>

  in place of . some people also use /
We are going with this <MICROSERVICENAME>.<ENV>.<KEY> because the starting representing itself will help us im understanding
   the microservice name


Suppose now we create a parameter with a name sample and provide the string value as Hello World and we try to accessible
 it from ansible.
  1. Start the instance you required and login in to workstation(putty where we run the command)

so first now if we need to get some parameter information over on the system normally from my workstation, how do i get.
   so basically we have AWS and you want to get the information by the way we can starting using AWS CLI.
 Now in you shell command(putty) give aws command and if you want to know about AWS CLI installation document you get it
   from the below path
      (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/get-parameters.html)

 1. So now give aws ssm get-parameters --names 'sample'  (Here sample is the name that we have provide in the parameter
    store with string data Hello World)
       if i run the above i am getting the below error because of unable to find the AWS credentials.
        Unable to locate credentials. You can configure credentials by running "aws configure".
      To overcome the above issue we need to create a user in amazon, to crete this we have a service called as IAM
      (Identity Access Management)
      IAM --> USRS --> create user
   In the organizations we don't have this creating user approach.

Now if i don't want to create the user but my workstation still need the information from the parameter store, so how does
 we get it. that is where ROLES comes into the picture.

What is ROLE?
 Role is nothing but providing an access to another service in Amazon.
    IAM --> ROLES --> Create Role --> select trusted entry type(based on requirement) for now we using AWS service -->
     select the service you need for EC2(now we using EC2 for my purpose) --> NEXT --> provide the particular access
     permission(since i making it for my workstation so for my workstation i would consider to do everything so just for
        time being i am going with Administrator access). this is only for my workstation and not for any other things
     --> Next --> provide the role name(i m providing as workstation-role) --> select create a role.

 Now the role we have created should be used by workstation by the way to do that we have to go for ec2 instance and
 delegate this to that particular instance.
  How we do is right click on the instance --> select security --> select modify IAM role -->  select the role you
   created --> update IAM role.

 Now if you go to you shell(putty) and provide the below command it execute successfully without any credentials error
     aws ssm get-parameters --names 'sample
  after executing the above command we get the string message we have provided.



Now we tell the ansible to get the data from the parameter store so if run the playbook in my workstation it can talk to
parameter store and fetch the details.
 So to fetch that there is some sort of support in aws in the way of collection. There are a lot of collections now just
    go to google and search for docs.ansible.com ---> click on collection Index --> select amazon.ws --> ssm_parameter
    lookup to get the value form SSM parameter --> there we find the examples. below is the example we consider
      - name: lookup ssm parameter store in the current region
        debug: msg="{{ lookup('amazon.aws.aws_ssm', 'Hello', region='us-east-1' ) }}"
        in place of hello we use sample you can refer the ansible code in these file 05-aws-ssm.yml

now execute the file with below command
    ansible-playbook 05-aws-ssm.yml

 after ececuting the above command we are getting these below error.
   Error was a <class 'ansible.errors.AnsibleError'>, original message: Failed to import the required Python library
     (botocore and boto3) on ip-172-31-41-11.ec2.internal's Python /usr/bin/python3.11.
  now in the command give sudo yum list | grep pip  you will get a list
  now give sudo yum install python3.11-pip.noarch -y   to install the 3.11 python in place yum we can also use dnf
  now give sudo pip3.11 install botocore boto3  once instllation is done now execute the below command.
    ansible-playbook 05-aws-ssm.yml
