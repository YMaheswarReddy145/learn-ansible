# Ansible is going to collect the facts by the way that means it connect to that particular node & fetches all the info,
  # and keep it handy and so that we can use it at any point of time.

# If you want to know the list of the facts that which are just variables then you can search by giving ansible facts list
  #  so you can get the ansible documentation with the list of facts that it gathers.
