What is Ad-Hoc?
  Ad-hoc means on demand.

Wht os on demand?
 Ansible playbook is a planned one so that means you planned what you need to do and we have written an ansible-playbook.


Most of the time we use playbook but sometimes if you want to connect to a node without playbook and need to do some
 operations, in that case Ad-hoc li we can connect to that node

 Suppose i want to run a command to find the free memory on the system without using playbook and print it on the screen
  then we hve ad-hoc
  ansible -i localhost, all -e ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps321 -m ansible.builtin.shell -a free

  Here we have given localhost ---> to check in tht particular host
                      all      --->
                      -m       ---> represent module name
        ansible.builtin.shell  --->  Module to execute
                      -a       ---> Module args
                     free      ---> to show the free space
